This homework is about creating an R package that has functions for the binomial distribution. The package lets you find out the binomial distribution probabilities and visualize them in tables and graphs. The package also allows you to compute different statistics such as mean, variance, mode, skewness, and kurtosis for distributions. The package includes summary and print functions for binvar objects that print out the statistics for the binomial variable object.
