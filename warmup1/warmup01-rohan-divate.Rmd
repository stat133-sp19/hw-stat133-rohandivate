# Boozy Baked French Toast

Ingredients

* 1 loaf supermarket Challah bread in 1-inch slices, no need for the super-fancy stuff here
* 3 cups whole milk
* 3 eggs
* 3 tablespoons sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon salt

Special kitchen tools

* baking dish

Instructions

1.	Generously grease a 9×13-inch baking dish with salted (my choice) or unsalted butter.
2.	Arrange bread in two tightly-packed layers in the pan. I always cut one slice into smaller pieces to fill in gaps, especially when using braided Challah. If using a thinner-sliced bread, you might wish for more layers, though I find that over three, even baking can be difficult. If you are using any fillings of fruit or nuts, this is the time to get them between the layers or sprinkled atop.
3.	Whisk milk, eggs, sugar, salt and booze or flavorings of your choice and pour over the bread. Sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar.
4.	Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. The bread will absorb all of the milk custard while you sleep.
5.	Bake at 425 for 30 minutes, or until puffed and golden. This will take longer if you have additional layers.
6.	Cut into generous squares and serve with maple syrup, fresh fruit, powdered sugar or all of the above.

You can make this recipe with different flavors.
Your choice of flavorings: I use 3 tablespoons Bailey’s and 3 tablespoons Cointreau, but Frangelico (hazelnut), Chambord (raspberry), Creme de Cassis (black currant) Grand Marnier or just a teaspoon or two of vanilla or almond extract can do the trick. 

Euclidean Distance

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\overline{\textbf{p}\textbf{q}}$).

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = $(p_1,p_2,...,p_n)$ and **q** = $(q_1,q_2,...,q_n)$ are two points in the Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

$$d(\textbf{p},\textbf{q}) = d(\textbf{q},\textbf{p}) = \sqrt{(q_1-p_1)^2 + (q_2-p_2)^2 +...+ (q_n-p_n)^2}$$
$$\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (q_i-p_i)^2}.$$

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The Euclidean norm, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$\left\lVert \textbf{p}\right\rVert$ = $\sqrt{ p_1^2 + p_2^2 +...+ p_n^2 }=\sqrt{\textbf{p}*\textbf{p}}$,

where the last expression involves the dot product.
