This homework is about examining the shots data of five different NBA players on the Golden State Warriors for the 2016 season. We do some data manipulation to prepare the data for analysis. We also compute summaries of the data for each player and produce a shot chart that shows the spot on the court where each shot was attempted and also indicates whether that shot was successful or not. Finally, we also compute shooting percentages for two point and three point shots for each player and produce a report for the data analysis.
